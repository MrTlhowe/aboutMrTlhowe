<p>Hi! I go by the name Thuto Tlhowe, a 19 year old boy who is currently studying at the Botswana Accountancy College as a first year student pursuing BSC HON Applied Business Computing. 
  A born and bred motswana from Kgatleng.This is a young boy who's much interested in soccer be it locally and internationally. I'm an ambitious and passionate and gaining knowledge about 
  my future career.I’m in a phase of life where I’m discovering more about who I am and what I want for the future. At 22, I feel a balance of excitement and responsibility as I transition
  from the uncertainties of early adulthood to a more defined sense of self. I’m passionate about exploring different interests, both in my personal life and career. I’m still figuring out
  where my skills and passions align, but I approach every experience with an open mind and a willingness to learn.I’ve learned that life is about continuous growth, and I embrace both the
  challenges and the rewards that come with that. Whether it's navigating work, relationships, or self-discovery, I’m focused on building the foundation for the future I want. I value deep
  connections with friends and family, and I believe that surrounding myself with supportive, like-minded people is essential. While I take my goals seriously, I also understand the importance
  of enjoying the journey, making time for self-care, and being present in the moment. I’m excited for the years ahead, knowing that each experience will bring me closer to the person I’m
  meant to become.</p>
